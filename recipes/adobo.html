    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken adobo is a classic Filipino dish made by braising chicken in a savory, tangy, and slightly sweet sauce typically composed of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, bay leaves, and black peppercorns. The chicken is simmered until tender, allowing the bold flavors to soak in. It’s often served with steamed white rice and is known for its rich taste and comforting aroma.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb chicken</li>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>2-3 tablespoons vinegar</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1-2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp whole black peppercorns</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>1 tbsp cooking oil</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Marinate</strong> - In a bowl or resealable bag, combine the chicken, soy sauce, garlic, bay leaves, and peppercorns. Let it marinate for 30 minutes to 1 hour (or overnight in the fridge for deeper flavor).</li>
            
            <li><strong>Sear the chicken</strong> - Heat the oil in a pan over medium heat. Remove chicken from the marinade (keep the marinade!) and brown the chicken pieces for a few minutes on each side until lightly golden.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Add Marinade</strong> - Pour the reserved marinade back into the pan, along with the vinegar, water, and sugar (if using). Do not stir yet after adding vinegar—let it boil first.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Simmer</strong> - Once it comes to a boil, lower the heat, cover, and let it simmer for 25–30 minutes, or until the chicken is tender. Stir occasionally.</li>

            <li><strong>Reduce</strong> - Remove the lid and let it simmer uncovered for another 5–10 minutes to reduce the sauce and intensify the flavor.</li>
        </ol>
